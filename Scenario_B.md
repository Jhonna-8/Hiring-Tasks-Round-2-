# Scenario B: Withdrawn student is requesting for reconsideration

Hi Pia!

We appreciate you working hard to submit your course requirement. As much as we want to have you back on the course, we wouldn't want you to be overworked. We do understand that you have enough on your plate already and we're afraid having the course at the same time will be overwhelming for you and might compromise one or the other. 

We want you to complete the course in a convinient way that's why we recommend you take the course next semester when you have better availability and less load. 

Looking forward to having you back on the course next semester!

All the best,
CodePath.org Team
