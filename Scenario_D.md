# Scenario D: Student wants to drop the course

Hi Ranchodas!

Congratulations to your internship at Microsoft! We acknowledge your request and as a response I have moved you to the **‘Observer’ Role** under CodePath Android Course. Be informed that being an ‘observer’ to the course means:
1. You have lifetime access to the course material and can study it at your own pace
2. No due dates or any expectations of observers imposed by CodePath.
3. We invite you to join our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst) to receive updates on upcoming courses and events

All the best,
CodePath.org Team
