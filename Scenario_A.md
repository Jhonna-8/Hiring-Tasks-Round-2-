# Scenario A: Correction on Attendance

Hi Raju!

Thanks for reaching out to us about your attendance in the recent class for the "*CodePath iOS Course in CUNY Hunter College*" program. Our records show that you've been marked as absent because you have stayed less than half of the class duration. 

As you know, attendance is core to our educational model! **A student will be marked as absent if:**
* *He/she did not attend the class at all*
* *He/she stayed less than half of the class duration*

In relation, one absence may result in removal from the course as outlined in our [course policies](https://duckduckgo.com).

Moving forward we encourage you to attend classes for atleast until half of the duration to avoid such scenarios.

All the best,
CodePath.org Team
